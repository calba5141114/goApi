# goApi
My first API in golang. This project is a work in progress and learning process for me.

## Setup
Make sure you have govendor installed and `$GOPATH/bin` in your path. Go should be installed and your go path should be setup correctly. Make sure to clone the repo in your go path.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/edwintcloud/goApi.git goApi
govendor sync
go run server.go
```
